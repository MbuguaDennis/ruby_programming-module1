# Module 1
## Fundamentals of Programming
### overview
In Module 1, students will learn programming fundamentals by building software in teams with Ruby and followwing object-oriented programming. They will develop skills to write automated tests, pseudocode, write implementation code, and refactor code to meet Ruby conventions. Through group projects and regular pairing exercises, students will learn skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers. Along the way students will see glimpses of JavaScript and how the fundamentals they are learning in Ruby translate to many programming languages.

* In Ruby, every method returns the last evaluated expression by default:
- abstraction helps us in
- One of the most important reasons we need methods is to 
**reuse code**
- methods run on objects
for examples
<code>
"hello world".upcase
<code>
upcase method is running on "Hello World",which is a **String object** 
think of methods like they are messages to an object.
The above code is saying,"Hey,string,give me an upcased version of yourself".


Method Lookup in Ruby
In Ruby, when you call a method on an object, Ruby needs to figure out where that method is defined. This process is called method lookup.
